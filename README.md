# RSA Algorithm in Python

This repository contains an implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm in Python. RSA is one of the most widely used asymmetric encryption algorithms that enables secure communication over insecure channels. It uses a pair of keys: a public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt it.

## Features

- **Key Generation**: Generates a public/private key pair based on large prime numbers.
- **Encryption**: Encrypts a plaintext message using the public key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts an encrypted message using the private key.
- **Digital Signatures**: Verifies the authenticity of a message using a private key and confirms integrity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pycryptodome` library (for cryptographic operations)

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haritimaatri/rsa-python.git
