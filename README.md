# RSA
This repository provides a Python implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm, demonstrating the principles of asymmetric encryption. RSA uses a public/private key pair for secure communication, where data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key.

# RSA Algorithm in Python

This repository contains an implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm in Python. RSA is one of the most widely used asymmetric encryption algorithms that enables secure communication over insecure channels. It uses a pair of keys: a public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt it.

## Features

- **Key Generation**: Generates a public/private key pair based on large prime numbers.
- **Encryption**: Encrypts a plaintext message using the public key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts an encrypted message using the private key.
- **Digital Signatures**: Verifies the authenticity of a message using a private key and confirms integrity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pycryptodome` library (for cryptographic operations)

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haritimaatri/rsa-python.git
